# üß± Print Friendly LEGO

This tool converts LEGO instruction manual PDFs (such as those used in the Botanicals Collection) into clean, print-friendly PNG images by:

1. **Converting PDF pages to high-resolution PNGs**
2. **Detecting and converting white-on-grey elements (e.g. arrows, step numbers) into black**
3. **Removing grey backgrounds** for clean output over white paper

## üì¶ Features

- üñ®Ô∏è Converts white text/lines near the original grey background into black for improved print readability
- üéØ Preserves white-filled callouts and graphics
- üßº Removes grey background (Defaults to #899093 range as used in the Botanicals Collection) last to prevent false positives
- üìÑ Works on any PDF manual with grey backgrounds and white linework

## üìÇ Folder Structure

After running the tool:

```bash

my\_manual.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my\_manual\_raw\_png/         ‚Üê High-res PNGs from original PDF

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pillow pdf2image scipy
```

> **Note:** On Linux, you may also need `poppler`:
>
> ```bash
> sudo apt install poppler-utils
> ```

### 2. Run the script

```bash
python combined_print_friendly_lego.py path/to/my_manual.pdf
```

Optional:

```bash
--dpi 300       # Set DPI (default 300 for high quality)
--background-colour "#8A8A8A"   # Set a different background colour to remove (default #899093 )
```

## üõ† How It Works

* **Grey Detection:** Uses a color distance threshold to detect background grey (#899093)
* **White Structure Conversion:** Finds white pixels adjacent to grey and converts their full connected components to black
* **Post-Processing:** Removes the grey pixels only at the end to avoid accidental over-conversion
